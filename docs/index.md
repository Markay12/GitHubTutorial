## What is Git?

Git is considered a version control system. A version control system is software that is designed the manage and track files over time.

This is great for large companies and many people working on the same project. With Git you are also able to

- track file changes
- compare versions
- share changes
- combine changes

This works just like a video game. When using GitHub you can just go back and create checkpoints until reaching the final version of the program.

Users can create alternate versions from multiple checkpoints called "branches", which will be referenced later. With this, users are able to jump and compare multiple versions of the same project. One can even merge these two projects together to update or create better versions.

## History of Git

Linus Torvalds created Linux and **also** created Git. He wanted to create more free software and the purpose was to have a free version control system. Now, lots of large companies use Git for their day-to-day company processes.

The government has used Git to solve typos and for version control in their documents. Git can also be used for novels, screenplays and writing.
